For us it’s about elevating shopping beyond a functional transaction to something much more powerful – a way of fostering and strengthening the yoga community; connecting us with people who share our values, enabling us to better look after each other, the planet, and ourselves.<BR /><BR />It’s our mission to create a community that champions these yogi makers, enabling them to anchor their business in success and give full expression to their creativity, and inspiring other members of the community to make the leap. <BR /><BR /><b>Join our mission!</b> Become an advocate for yogi makers. <BR /><BR />Lucy x</div><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="meetmakerP">#MadeByYogis</span></div><br /><hr><br /> <div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont">What is your Advocate Programme? </span></div><div class="Midtexts">The YogaClicks Advocate Programme is similar to an Affiliate Programme but with a better - fairer - rewards structure. It’s a way of earning money by referring your friends and followers to our shop via your website, blog, emails and/or social media.</div><br /><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont">What’s the difference between a standard Affiliate Programme and our Advocate Programme? </span></div><div class="Midtexts"><b>How a standard Affiliate Programme works:</b><br /><br>When your followers click your link to our store, that click is recorded on a 30 day cookie. If they purchase within 30 days you receive your commission.<br> <br><b>We think that’s wrong!</b> What if your person buys after 30 days? You get nothing! <br> <br><b>How our Advocate Programme works:</b> <br> <br>When your followers click through to YogaClicks, that click is recorded on a 365 day cookie. That’s right – on our programme you earn commission for a full year! Even if your customer goes away and comes back to the site directly, without using your code, the cookie will know that it’s you who created the sale and we pay you the commission.</div><br /><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont">What’s in it for me?</span></div> <div class="Midtexts">You will make 10% of every sale you generate. The more people you refer, the more money you’ll make. You can earn another 5% by enrolling other Advocates in our programme. Email advocate@yogaclicks.com for more on this. <br /><br /><b>There are four other big upsides:</b><br /><br />You are connecting your people with other yogis who share the same ethical values – enabling us to better look after each other, the planet, and ourselves. <br /><br />You are inspiring your people with the beautiful creativity of the yoga community.<br /><br />You are anchoring yogi makers in commercial success, to create a yogi made business world.<br /><br />We will advocate you! Share your expertise on our blog and we’ll share your wisdom with our community!</div><br /><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont"> What’s in it for my people?</span></div> <div class="Midtexts">Give them the code MADEBYYOGIS for 10% off. <br /><br />Both you and your people also get over 9 hours of FREE yoga classes with some of London’s top teachers. <a href="https://www.yogaclicks.store/collections/classes-and-dvds/products/video-classes-bundle-deal?variant=17301758149">Click the link</a> to access. </div><br /><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont">How do we know that the sale came from you? </span></div> <div class="Midtexts">Sales are independently verified by <a href="https://www.refersion.com/">Refersion</a>.

There are two ways of working with YogaClicks as an Advocate. You can go digital or old school or both, whatever you prefer. Registering as an Advocate gives you a self-administered dashboard that enables you to track your sales. <br /><br /><b>Digital set up</b><br /><br /><ul><li>1.<a href="https://www.yogaclicks.store/pages/affiliate-sign-up">Click this</a>link to register as an Advocate:</li> <li>2. Go to your dashboard and collect your Advocate code</li> <li>3. Copy and paste the code into your website, blog, social media, and/or newsletter</li></ul> <br />Our data says Advocates who place the link prominently on the Menu bar see up to three times more sales. <br /><br /><b>Old school set up</b> <br /><br /><ul><li>1. <a href="https://www.yogaclicks.store/pages/affiliate-sign-up">Click this</a> link to register as an Advocate</li><li>2. Email advocate@yogaclicks.com telling us you want to go old school and we’ll create a unique URL (web address) for you - like anika.yogaclicks.store/.</li><li>3. Share the URL with your people - in a yoga class, on a noticeboard, on a leaflet or card.</li></ul> <br />As with the digital version, when your people visit our shop using this link your unique code is automatically applied at checkout. <br /><br />Both ways are tracked by Refersion, an independent authority, and pay in the same way.</div><br /><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont"> Where do I get the marketing materials? </span></div> <div class="Midtexts">We have created a range of text and images for your site, blog, newsletter and/or social media. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s24oz699opcoypw/AAAnrNQZh6zFuIbDOokAQYMra?dl=0">Click here</a> to access. <br /><br />If you want to go old school and would like to apply for some YogaClicks postcards to hand out to your people please email us:advocate@yogaclicks.com.</div><br /><div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont">Where do I sign? </span></div><div class="Midtexts">You can sign up for our Advocate Programme by <a href="https://www.yogaclicks.store/pages/affiliate-sign-up">clicking here.</a></div><br /> <div class="Midtexts paddingP"><span class="QuestionFont"> Got another question?</span></div> <div class="Midtexts">Email advocate@yogaclicks.com for more information.</div><br /><br /></div></div></div></div>
