<div data-brands-toggle="Beautiful Mind Beautiful Body">Beautiful Mind Beautiful Body by Julia White is a holistic and unique approach to yoga; integrating yoga to energise, motivate and balance mind and body, Ayurvedic principles, aromatherapy and essential oils to produce a physical, spiritual, emotional and mental sense of wellbeing leading to a happier and healthier life. <br><br>
The Beautiful Mind Beautiful Body Product Range contains essential oils to balance each Dosha; to balance Vata, Pitta and Kapha. <br><br>
Aromatic plants and oils have been used for thousands of years as perfumes, incense and cosmetics as well as for their medicinal and culinary applications. In Aromatherapy, essential oils are used both for their scent and for their healing properties. Essential oils are absorbed readily through the skin and into the bloodstream and when we breathe in the aroma, the molecules of the essential oil are quickly absorbed into our bloodstream via the delicate tissues that line our lungs. Essential oils are effective for both physical and emotional well being. <br><br>
Julia White has been practicing yoga for many years. She is a fully qualified and accredited yoga teacher and a member of the British Wheel of Yoga and Yoga Alliance.

<div data-brands-toggle="Positivitea">
Based on the ancient Indian healing system of the chakras, Positivitea is a range of seven delicious herbal teas blended to bring the balance back, one chakra at a time.<br><br>
Says Positivitea creator Ellie, "Put simply the chakras are the energy centres of the body. When they are balanced you feel positive, healthy and happy. Each tea has been specifically blended to help the smooth running of a particular chakra or counteract the ailments associated with its imbalance. For example, the heart chakra blend (LOVE) has hawthorn in it which strengthens the muscles of the heart and the third eye chakra (IMAGINE) has eyebright which strengthens the retinas of the eyes."<br><br>
The inspiration came from a yoga class which focused on the root chakra (for grounding and security). Ellie came out of that class wanting a tea to help compliment the practice. Says Ellie, "I remember thinking how ludicrous it was that there wasn’t a brand of teas that helped balance the chakras considering how popular yoga was (and is) and that was the moment Positivitea was born. Well actually that was the “a-ha” moment – the name Positivitea came to me on the bus on the way home!"

Today, along with her husband, she sells a versatile range of products that reduce the amount of ingredients applied onto skin every morning and the bottles cluttering up the bathroom. <br><br>
Nat focuses on creating products that put emphasis on less is more whilst looking beautiful on the shelves. Every product fits into 1 of 4 categories: Clean, Nourish, Moisturise, Relax, and the aim is that every product will have more than one function and can become a staple in anyone's daily household/beauty routine.
